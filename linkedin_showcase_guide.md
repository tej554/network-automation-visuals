# How to Showcase This on LinkedIn

Now that your diagrams are on GitHub, here is how to feature them on your LinkedIn profile to attract recruiters and peers.

## 1. Add to "Featured" Section
The "Featured" section is the first thing people see on your profile.

1.  Go to your LinkedIn Profile.
2.  Scroll to the **Featured** section (if you don't have it, click "Add profile section" > "Recommended" > "Add featured").
3.  Click the **+ (Plus)** icon.
4.  Select **Add a link**.
5.  Paste your GitHub Repository URL: `https://github.com/tej554/network-automation-visuals` (Verify this URL is correct).
6.  **Title**: "Network Automation Visuals & Architecture".
7.  **Description**: "A collection of architectural diagrams, roadmaps, and mindmaps for Network Automation and OT Security. Built with Mermaid.js."
8.  **Thumbnail**: LinkedIn might auto-fetch the README image. If not, it will show a GitHub logo. This is fine, but a post (Option 2) looks better.

## 2. Create a "Project" Post (Best Visuals)
Instead of just a link, create a post and feature *that post*.

1.  **Create a new post**.
2.  **Upload**: Choose 3-5 of the best images from this repo (e.g., `01-starter-roadmap.png`, `02-automation-pyramid.png`, `10-automation-stack.png`).
3.  **Write a caption**:
    > 🚀 Just open-sourced my personal collection of Network Automation diagrams!
    >
    > I've built a repository of visual guides covering:
    > ✅ The Automation Starter Roadmap
    > ✅ OT Engineer Career Paths
    > ✅ Network-as-Code Stacks
    >
    > These are designed to help engineers visualize the journey from CLI to CI/CD.
    >
    > Check out the full repo here: [Link to GitHub]
    >
    > #NetworkAutomation #NetDevOps #Python #Cisco #OTSecurity
4.  **Post it**.
5.  Go to the post, click the **... (three dots)** in the top right -> **Feature on top of profile**.
    *   *Why this is better*: It shows the actual images in your Featured section, which is much more engaging than a generic link.

## 3. Create a Carousel (PDF)
LinkedIn loves PDF carousels.

1.  Combine your best diagrams into a single PDF (you can use Canva or a "Images to PDF" tool).
2.  Create a post and select **Add a document**.
3.  Upload the PDF.
4.  Title it: "The Ultimate Network Automation Visual Guide".
5.  Post and **Feature** it.

## 4. Add to "Projects" Section
1.  Go to "Add profile section" > "Additional" > "Add projects".
2.  **Project name**: Network Automation Visuals.
3.  **Skills**: Network Automation, Python, Ansible, Architecture.
4.  **Project URL**: Your GitHub Link.
5.  **Description**: "Created a comprehensive visual documentation repository for network automation concepts..."
